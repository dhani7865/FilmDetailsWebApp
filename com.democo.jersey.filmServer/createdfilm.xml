        <director>RIDLEY SCOTT</director>
        <stars>GERARD DEPARDIEU, ARMAND ASSANTE</stars>
        <review>The story of Columbus discovering America, beautifully shot in Costa Rica and excellently played by an top-notch cast including Tcheky Karyo, Michael Wincott and Sigourney Weaver as the Queen of Spain. Interestingly the script shows Columbus mercenary side by detailing the deals he wanted in return for discovering this new world before eventually having to return home in disgrace.</review>

        <review>The title number is the police code for a homicide, and its heard more than once in this tough ghetto school drama. Samuel L.Jackson (Pulp Fiction / Sphere) plays a teacher who goes to an inner city school to find it completely out of control. After being robbed by one of the pupils he returns, determined to take the law into his own hands. From the director of Robin Hood - Prince Of Thieves.</review>

        <director>ADRIAN LYNE</director>
        <stars>MICKEY ROURKE, KIM BASINGER</stars>
        <review>Director Lyne shows his pop video roots in this erotic tale reputedly based on a true story. Basinger falls for stubble-cheeked Rourke and a steamy, sadomasochistic relationship begins. It lasts the period of the title before the intensity gets too much for her.  Joe Cockers version of You Can Leave Your Hat On accompanies a Basinger strip routine and then theres the infamous fridge sequence.</review>

Concentrating on one team, the Rockford Peaches whose members include Davis, Madonna, and Lori Petty. Broken-down coach Tom Hanks has to knock them into some sort of shape.</review>

        <director>RENNY HARLIN</director>
        <stars>ROBERT ENGLUND, RODNEY EASTMAN</stars>
        <review>Not one of the better outings for Freddy Krueger, being little more than a series of admittedly spectacular special effects sequences. Here hes still tormenting a group of teenagers through their dreams, but may have met his match in a girl with telekinetic powers. Each murder is capped off with the usual one-liners. Director Renny Harlin went on to direct Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight.</review>

        <review>Confused sequel with the spirit of Freddy Kruger coming back to possess a young teenager (Mark Patton). Soon hes dispatching his enemies, such as a sadistic gym teacher, until Freddy makes his return to the real world and causes havoc at a poolside party. Not the best in the series.</review>

        <review>The one that started the long-running Freddy Krueger series and still the best. When a group of teenagers start to have dreams about a scarred killer wearing a glove with blades on the fingers, they do not know that he is coming back for revenge for being murdered by their parents years before. When the kids start to die one girl tries to unravel the horrifying mystery of his identity. A very early performance from a young Johnny Depp.</review>

        <review>The man of your dreams is about to go bye-byes, as he finally gets his comeuppance after taking on his own daughter (somebody never even mentioned in the series so far). Some of the cassettes available included the last reel in 3D, although you need the special glasses. And yes, hes well and truly dead. Until Wes Cravens New  Nightmare that is!!</review>

        <stars>RICHARD KEATS, LISA ANN RUSSELL</stars>
        <review>Okay sci-fi with good ideas but hampered by a pretty obvious lack of budget. A  scientist travels back in time to retrieve an experimental probe but unwittingly  infects the present with a virus. When he goes back to the future the plague has decimated mankind, and hunter / killer robots roam the wastelands.  Decent effects considering the money available, but its pretty obvious theyve only got three robot suits at any one time.</review>

        <stars>GREGORY HINES, FOREST WHITAKER</stars>
        <review>Very entertaining period comedy drama set in the 50s, taken from the book by  Chester Himes. Ex-Mrs Mike Tyson Robin Givens hides out in Harlem with a stash of stolen gold and tries to hang onto it while being hunted by everyone from the Mob owners of the loot to Hines as a phony  priest. Danny Glover is superb in a small role as a tough gangster totally devoted to his tiny pet poodle. Terrific soundtrack too.</review>

        <stars>BRAD PITT, EMILY LLOYD</stars>
        <review>Slightly rambling but thoroughly enjoyable family saga, with Tom Skeritt teaching his sons the virtues theyll need for later life, as well as instilling in them a love of fly-fishing. The boys (Pitt and Craig Sheffer) eventually leave home but one of them is going to be seduced by the vices of the big city, leading to a tragic end.  Great performances all round including Brenda Blethyn as the boys mother.</review>

        <review>Childrens fantasy starring Mara Wilson from Matilda. She plays the daughter of one of Central Parks horse drawn cab drivers who longs for a fairy godmother to grant her special wish for her dad. However, the character who appears with a magic wand is Murray (Martin Short), the least qualified fairy godmother on the block. Lots of wild special effects and with Kathleen Turner as an evil witch.</review>

        <stars>MARTIN LAWRENCE, LYNN WHITFIELD</stars>
        <review>The directorial debut of comedian Martin Lawrence  (Bad Boys, Nothing To Lose). Fatal Attraction played for laughs with Lawrence having a one-night stand with Whitfield and then finding she thinks one night is not enough and wants more of him - at gunpoint if necessary. His comedy comes across much better in his stand-up performance film You So Crazy.</review>

        <review>Not the best movie in the series with which Moore to choose to end his tenure of the 00 prefix but it has its moments in the set-pieces and stunts. Christopher Walken is a genetically-perfect psychopath, created via a test-tube, whose plan is to destroy Californias Silicone Valley thus leaving his company as the only source of computer technology.

        <review>Glorious send-up of 60s spy movies with Myers playing both the title role and the villain of the piece, Dr. Evil. Returning to Earth after being frozen in space, Dr. Evil has various evil schemes, but also defrosted from cryo-sleep is Austin Powers, a swinging 60s icon with terrible teeth, crushed velvet suits in a variety of revolting colours and some very non-90s attitudes. Very accurate and constantly entertaining.</review>

But the effects are not permanent. De Niro plays a man revived after 30 years and begins to discover love before the side effects kick in.</review>

        <review>Possibly the goriest film of all time, a breakneck gore-soaked black comedy from Peter Jackson, director of the equally quirky Bad Taste. After his mum is bitten by a Sumartran Rat-Monkey at the zoo and starts to rot away of a strange infection, thats the cue for zombies, kickboxing priests, bodies ripped asunder and death by lawnmower. So gory you just have to laugh. Jackson went on to make the more sedate Heavenly Creatures.</review>

Brewing it up and having a slug he turns into a glamorous woman (Sean Young from Blade Runner), but the side effects are even worse. Hammer did it more entertainingly with Dr. Jekyll And Sister Hyde.</review>

        <stars>SEAN CONNERY, URSULA ANDRESS</stars>
        <review>The first in the series and an almost  low-key entry compared to later films. Sean Connery gives gravity to the role of James Bond, 007, investigating the murder of MI5 agents in Jamaica and coming up against the criminal mastermind with steel hands, Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman). Ursula Andress made a fine early appearance as Honey Rider, appearing out of the surf with a dagger tucked into her bikini.</review>

        <review>Broad spoof from Brooks with Leslie Nielsen going out for the Count under a barrage of lame jokes. He moves to England to find further victims, with Mel himself as the demented vampire hunter Van Helsing. All the gags are pretty obvious and you dont need a telescope to see the punchlines coming.

While Friday Jr is almost living in a time-warp, complete with snap-brim fedora, he is partnered with Tom Hanks, a very 80s cop with morals to match. Together they investigate what appears to be a Satanic cult operating in L.A. under the guise of a moral crusade.qqqWith Alexandra Paul from TVs Baywatch.</review>

        <review>Tim Burtons loving evocation of simply the worst film maker the world has ever known. Depp plays Wood as a completely driven individual, having total faith in his projects despite his absolute lack of talent.

Turning the tables on him lands her in jail and a lot more trouble. Startling drama and not for the shockable. Very strong language.</review>

        <review>Very powerful and absorbing real-life story of the rise and fall of John Gotti, ruthless head of the powerful Gambino Mafia family who was nicknamed The Teflon Don because the police could never get evidence to stick. It took a  member of his organisation to turn supergrass to finally bring him to justice. Excellent performances and atmosphere.</review>

        <review>From Big Chill director Lawrence Kasdan,  ensemble drama in a similar vein. After being saved from a mugging by a black mechanic (Glover), a lawyer (Kline) is forced to reevaluate his life. Kasdan obviously has something to say, but were not too sure what. With Mary McDonnell, Sarah Jessica Parker and, in a more serious than usual role, Steve Martin as an aggressive producer of violent films .</review>

After a long-closed textile mill is reopened and workers start to be injured, gruff and heartless owner Stephen Macht just puts it down to the age of the buildings and their disrepair. He doesnt know theres something underneath waiting to come out and gnaw through the rest of his staff. The settings and photography are all suitably unsettling.</review>

Songs include Youre The One That I Want, Sandy, Greased Lightning, and the title song, especially written for the film by The Bee Gees and sung by Frankie Valli.</review>

        <review>A decidedly different spin for Chuck, he plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer. Nothing new there perhaps but the killer (Neame) is an unleashed demon, released from his tomb by grave robbers in the Middle East. Now hes in the real world and Chuck has to stop him. Directed by Chucks brother, also responsible for Delta Force 2.</review>

        <review>The Cenobites return for another go at Ashley Lawrence in this sequel to the Clive Barker original. Still after the mystical puzzle box, they interest a doctor (Kenneth Cranham) who has plans to join their depraved ranks. Confusing plot and occasionally wobbly effects.</review>

        <review>The first of the franchise introducing the Cenobites, apostles of evil and worshippers of pain. When a couple move into a new home the wife manages to revive her dead ex, Frank. But if Frank is to become complete rather than just flesh and bone more people will have to die. Great atmospheric photography and costume design on an obviously limited budget.

        <review>Disappointing and confused closer to the series, here the Cenobites follow a family through generations, from a debauched French aristocrat who dabbled with evil through a modern day couple tangling with Pinhead and co., before an Aliens style finale aboard a space station. Pinhead, your time is up. The credit Alan Smithee hides directors Kevin Yeager and Joe Chappelle, who had their names taken off this.</review>

        <review>Probably the best of the lot, an imaginative and scary sequel with the Cenobites still trying to get possession of the devilish puzzle box. Doug Bradley returns as Pinhead with Terry Farrell from Deep Space Nine as the investigative reporter who gets involved. Director Hickox comes up with some really chilling stuff.

        <review>Disturbing and often shocking film following the title character, a remorseless sociopath, shot in almost documentary style.

It was John Brown, one of the groundsmen on her Scottish estates, who brought her back to health, mostly by treating her as an ordinary person and not a regal personage. Terrific performances from both Dench and Connolly add to the charm.</review>

Jon Lovitz (City Slickers II) plays a teacher who goes to the school with the worst reputation in America, an institution so tough it even has its own cemetery in the schoolyard.

Living through the centuries he finds that one of their number, a renegade called Kurgan, is killing all the other Immortals. A wild concept but well handled by director Mulcahy with great support from Connery as a flamboyant Egyptian and Clancy Brown as the menacing Kurgan.</review>

        <review>From the people who brought you A  Room With A View and The Remains Of The Day, a study of two families in Edwardian times and the problems their love lives produce when it comes to the subject of a house called   Howards End. Typical attention to period detail and solid performances from Anthony Hopkins,  Helena Bonham Carter, James Wilby and Emma Thompson who won an Oscar for this.</review>

        <stars>BRUCE WILLIS, ANDIE MACDOWELL</stars>
        <review>Disastrously silly caper yarn with Bruce Willis as the title character, a cat burglar who is just so irritating its untrue. This particular yarn involves him  in a spate of art thefts leading up to the lifting of a Da Vinci manuscript. Support from Richard E.Grant and Danny Aiello, who should have known better. Andie MacDowell replaced European actress Maruschka Detmers, who walked off the film after a couple of days. Good move.</review>

A young actor tries to stage a version of Hamlet in an abandoned village hall, but attracts a cast of has-beens, never-weres and assorted misfits. Still, the show must go on.

Garcia plays a cop newly assigned to the Internal Affairs department of the L.A. police force who soon becomes utterly obsessed with busting a supposedly corrupt cop (Gere being surprisingly menacing). But Gere isnt going to let an I.A. rookie disturb his web of scams and corruption. The original brutal ending was refilmed after previews.</review>

Although having had only the briefest tutoring by his commanding officer (Gossett), he steals an F-16 Tomcat fighter jet and heads off to get his dad back. Amazing to think the director made The Ipcress File back in the 60s. Followed by three increasingly implausible sequels.</review>

        <review>Try as it might, the subject matter for this drama is just too depressing to be uplifting. A man dying of Aids plans one last party for his family and friends before committing suicide before the disease gets a hold of him. Eric Roberts is fine in the central role, playing a man determined to be in charge of his own fate, but it is still a distressing premise.

With the town torn apart by two rival gangs, he finds he can pit both sides against each other with violent results. If the plot sounds familiar its based on the Japanese film Yojimbo, which also inspired A Fistful Of Dollars.</review>

Also returning are Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Randy Quaid and David Keith.</review>

Will he succeed? Do you doubt it for a moment? An updated remake of a 1953 comedy The Private War Of Major Payne, which nobody saw either.</review>

        <review>Three-hour plus retelling of the life story of Malcolm X, a vital character in the Black Muslim movement and who was eventually killed by his own followers after his fanaticism seemed to be softening. Washington is impressive if the treatment is a little over-emphatic. Powerful support from Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo, and Giancarlo Esposito.</review>

        <review>Kevin Smiths follow-up to the micro-budgeted Clerks, but following much the same formula. Two slackers hang out in the local shopping mall, just passing the time by insulting shoppers and the security staff. Not a lot else happens. With Shannen Doherty from Beverly Hills 90210 and leading screen heavy Michael Rooker (Sea Of Love / Cliffhanger). Smith then went on to make Chasing Amy.</review>

        <review>Lavish and literate version of the tale, covering aspects in the book not usually shown on screen such as the opening and closing Arctic scenes. Branagh is the dedicated Doc and De Niro the patchwork creature he creates in this terrifically designed and photographed retread.

        <stars>STEVE MARTIN, MADELINE KAHN</stars>
        <review>Disappointing Steve Martin comedy set at a Samaritans-like telephone help line on Christmas Eve. As the festive season grows closer, so the calls get more and more desperate. A good cast including Juliette Lewis (Strange Days), Anthony LaPaglia (Innocent Blood) and Liev Schreiber (Scream, Scream 2) are all wasted. Taken from the French film Le Pere Est Une Ordure, the translation of which is very  rude.</review>

        <stars>CHRISTIAN SLATER, PATRICK DEMPSEY</stars>
        <review>Extremely violent gangster tale concerning the careers of four of historys biggest hoods when they were young men - Lucky Luciano (Slater), Frank Costello (Dempsey), Mayer Lansky (Costas Mandylor) and Bugsy Siegel (Richard Grieco). In a loose alliance they take on the established order in the shape of Anthony Quinn, Michael Gambon and F. Murray Abraham. Not strictly historically accurate but a well-made gangster flick.</review>

        <review>Family comedy with a surprisingly light turn from the usually menacing Harvey Keitel.

        <review>Enjoyable sci-fi hokum from prolific director John Eyres (Project Shadowchaser series / Conspiracy Of Fear), with lots of action and explosions to cover up the rather confused plot. Paxton and Frost are two cops who see a woman remorselessly kill a young child. They think its a normal murder case but find the child was in fact possessed by a devastating alien force that can move from human to human. Good fast-paced fun.</review>

        <review>Perhaps the Pythons best big-screen offering, the story of lowly Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman). Through various mix-ups he is hailed as a messiah, no matter how much he tries to dissuade his ever-increasing band of followers. Some sharp knocks at cults and brilliantly comic situations.

        <review>Possibly the low-point of the 007 series, with lame puns and double-entendres taking precedence over action and plot. Bond is this time pitted against Hugo Drax (Lonsdale) in a re-run of the plot of You Only Live Twice. Drax is stealing space shuttles via an elaborate space station, and plans to wipe out the worlds population with nerve gas and replace them with his own genetically engineered perfect race. Disappointing.</review>

        <review>The one that started the whole series of films revolving around the rude and crude antics of college fraternities. This is the best of all, the story  of Delta House, packed with all the misfits and weirdoes on the college campus. The Dean decides to get them out, by fair means or foul. Highly comic cast includes Dan Aykroyd, Tom Hulce,  Peter Reigart and Donald Sutherland as a despairing teacher.</review>

The crunch comes when Chase does not receive his expected Xmas bonus and goes berserk, kidnapping his boss. Unsubtle but very funny in parts.</review>

First up is the tale of a ship wreck and its ghostly consequences, while the second tells of the terrible fate of a mad scientist (Warner). But the third, directed by Yuzna, is the topper, the story of a policewoman venturing underground in pursuit of a suspect and falling into a true vortex of utter horror.</review>

He plays a 30s gangster who swears to go straight after his father (Kirk Douglas) asks him as his dying wish. As you can imagine, its not as easy as that. With veteran Don Ameche, Marisa Tomei, Peter Reigert and Robocops Kurtwood Smith. Good period detail but not many laughs.</review>

        <review>Oliver Stones hard-hitting Vietnam story, with Charlie Sheen as a young recruit on a tour of duty. His platoon is divided into two camps, one led by embittered scarred veteran Tom Berenger. The other is headed by Willem Dafoe, just wanting to survive long enough to get home. As the Vietnamese forces get closer the tension in the unit mounts. Despite the 15 certificate, this is very adult stuff, with graphic violence and strong language.</review>

One of the top cops on the Hong Kong force, hes framed by a crime lord, forcing him to clear his own name and arrest the man who set him up, which he does in typically destructive fashion in a hi-tech shopping mall.

        <review>Strictly Ballroom director Baz Luhrmanns brilliant interpretation of Shakespeares classic play, transplanted into 90s L.A. and with pistols replacing rapiers. De Caprio and Danes are the star-crossed lovers, trying to keep out of the way of the warring families. All the original text is there, combined with dazzling visuals and a tremendous soundtrack including the horribly catchy Lovefool by The Cardigans.</review>

An excellent dramatised version of the now famous Roswell incident where something crashed in the desert in new Mexico in 1947 and the military were immediately on the scene, taking away the evidence and claiming it was a weather balloon.

His loyalty changes, pitting him against the equally ruthless Colonel Madden (William Sadler from Die Hard 2). A lot of things, and people, get blown up.</review>

He does not realise that tomboy drummer Mary Stuart Masterton is devoted to him but wont reveal her feelings. Fine pop soundtrack includes tracks by Propaganda and Lick The Tins.</review>

Not as good as his Drebin outings but has its moments. Hilariously funny, and very accurate, opening title sequence spoofs the Bond films, with a title song by Weird Al Yankovich.</review>

As the German forces, hampered by inadequate kit and clothing, besiege the city during one of the coldest winters ever known, food runs out within forcing some of the trapped inhabitants to try to make a break for freedom.

        <review>True masterpiece of horror from Italian director Argento, whose work went into a tail spin in the mid 80s. This is probably his finest work, a tale of terror revolving around an American ballet student who discovers the exclusive Black Forest academy in which she is studying is a haven for black magic. Only the Nouveux Pictures release is uncut, widescreen and with stereo sound. All previous releases are cut and of very poor technical quality.</review>

Never missing a chance to abuse or yell at his staff, Spacey is finally kidnapped by Whaley when he cracks and turns the tables on his bully of an employer.

        <review>Big screen spin-off from the cable TV series. The Cryptkeeper introduces a grisly tale involving Bill Sadler (Trespass) as the keeper of a sacred key, passed down through generations and very much the object of desire of Billy Zane as the Lord Of Darkness himself. Having chased each other for centuries, Sadler holes up in a remote hotel as Zane musters his armies of the dead for a final all-out assault. Great fun with good effects.</review>

When the affair comes to media attention, the opposition try to dig up dirt on her past to use against the President. The White House wouldnt allow shooting in the actual rooms so Reiner and co created their own authentic looking rooms and offices in the studio.</review>

        <review>The rather long story of the Lizard King, Jim Morrison, and his bands rise to fame, leading to his eventual breakdown and mysterious death in Paris in the 70s. Great cast includes small roles for Kyle McLachlan, Michael Madsen, Kathleen Quinlan and Mimi Rogers among others. Kilmer is terrific, but Stone will insist on  imaginary American Indians bobbing about the place as he did in Natural Born Killers!</review>

        <review>Slightly disappointing sequel to Star Wars but still featuring one of the best sequences of the entire trilogy - the opening battle on the ice planet of Hoth where we first see the fearsome Imperial Walkers, armoured tanks on legs. Effects are all well up to scratch but theres an annoying cliffhanger ending where Han Solo is left frozen in a block of alloy and Luke is still reeling from a revelation about Darth Vader.</review>

With the pride of the village severely blunted, they decide to keep the mapmakers captive until they change their minds. Slight but amusing, with Colm Meaney from The Van and Con-Air.</review>

The playing of some audio tapes unleashes terrible evil forces which turn three of the four into shrieking zombies.

        <review>A clerical error means that college student Lara Flynn Boyle has to share her lodgings with two men (Baldwin and Josh Charles), one of whom is gay.

When they get there Bernie is stone cold dead, the victim of an assassin, and have to convince the others arriving for the weekend that Bernie is still alive. Inventive slapstick for the undiscerning, followed by a poor sequel.</review>

        <review>Not a brilliant sequel. The two protagonists from the first film (McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman) on a hunt for the money stowed away by Bernie (Kiser), the body they had to lag around in the original. Believing the cash is in the Caribbean, they drag the body along, hoping to have it revived by voodoo and  able to lead them to the loot. The best gags are the bad taste ones.</review>

        <review>Three hours long but always gripping version of the life of Wyatt Earp. It  shows him in a more critical light than the more popular Tombstone, which was made at exactly the same time. Costner is at his best as Earp, with Dennis Quaid as the dying Doc Holliday. The large cast includes  Gene Hackman as Earps father Michael Madsen, Mark Harmon,  Jeff Fahey and Bill Pullman. Recommended.</review>
